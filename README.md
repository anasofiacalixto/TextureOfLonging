# textureOfLonging

Repo for the interactive research Texture of Longing, developed for Goldsmiths University of London

**In short**

texture of longing is a research on how translating memories into physical objects, and how the experience of empathy can be expanded through data retrieval and analysis. The prompt was to create a physically interactive system using C++ and Arduino. A teaser can be seen at: https://anasofiacalixto.com/works/texture-of-longing/

**Concept and Background Research**

The research has started from practical experiments. Participants wear sensors while retrieving and sharing personal memory. The sensors trigger different motors, which pump liquid resin mapped to the organic data. In the final step of the process, the resin solidifies creating an abstract sculpture with form, texture and colours coming defined by the emotions.

The gadget gathers data from different parts of the body, suggesting that memories do not only exist in rational thoughts, but superimposed to the body itself, as if we are constantly wearing layers of parallel existences. The aim is to explore how human feelings could be duplicated, in other environments, into tangible elements. Poetically speaking, the project aims at being a form of “teleportation of emotions”.

An article on the research will be published soon, updates will be shared on the link above.
